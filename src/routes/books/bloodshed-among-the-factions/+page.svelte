  <h3>HONOR, GLORY, AND DESTRUCTION IN THE NEW AGE.</h3>
  <p>
    Articles, newspaper clippings, and handwritten accounts from various presses and authors
    are bound neatly to the pages of this book. While some of the pages are pristine, smelling
    of freshly pressed paper, others are scorched and written over older faded pages torn from
    other books. It is obvious that they come from vastly different regions. Each page details
    the events of the greater conflicts in the modern wars between Factions. The first page
    contains a short preface.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      "History is written by the victors" -I can't recall where I heard this phrase, but there
      aren't any truer words to address the ongoing strife between the factions. How much more
      destruction will they wage on the world and what stories will be lost as a result?
      Perhaps we'll never know. We're almost clueless about of the iron beasts and steel husks
      littering the deserts and frozen wastelands because the dead can't write! Unfortunately,
      there were no victors in that cataclysm. Just a whole bunch of mystery buried in the
      rubble and not a single hand to jot down any notes of what happened. Hopefully we can get
      it right this time around.

<h2 id="ridge-forest-brawl">Ridge Forest Brawl</h2>
<article>
  <p>
    The Ridge Forest Brawl was as intense as it was short. The skirmish was dominated by the
    Chaladonians whose small and nimble fleets wreaked havoc in the mainland. The Baronites
    suffered many losses but were able to maintain a hold of their rolling hills from the
    threats from all sides, but the constant bombardment from the southern Mercantile Guild
    will likely put a strain on their future relationships. The Anglean Republic was a nation
    to be feared, with the most members and deadliest weaponry, but it seemed like their icy
    exterior was quickly thawed by the Mercantile and Chaladonian advancements. Chaladon's
    momentum seemed unstoppable as they encroached further and further into the mainland, and
    eventually spreading both to the north and to the south. However, a Mercantile resistance
    force was able to stymie the push and regain lost territories in the nigh hour. There was
    much disagreement at the thought of an accord, but the Mercantile Guild ultimately realized
    that their trade would benefit in a calmer environment instead of their supply lines being
    constantly disrupted by chaos. If the accord was not reached, the skirmish would have
    likely turned into a full-fledged war that pit the Chaladonians and Merchants against each
    other. We'll never know where the two remaining factions would pledge their allegiance to.
    Only until war erupts will we know the factions' true colors.

<h2 id="outsiders-war">Outsiders' War</h2>
<article>
  <p>
    Once again, war has swept across the land. The Outsiders' War, named after the unusual
    alliances formed, was quick and but narrowly decisive. The war was kindled by the
    Chaladonians as they claimed mines from the Merchants for new heavy manufacture, and
    secured land from the Baronites to protect the farms from being overburdened and stripped
    bare of resources. Despite exploiting weak Chaladonian convoys and retrieving unheard of
    amounts of essential goods, champions like <span class="player baron">Skyraider</span>
    of the Fjord Baronies,
    <span class="player anglean">TzeroX</span> of the Angleans Republic, and
    <span class="player merchant">El Yuron</span> of the Mercantile Guild could not stop the
    likes of <span class="player">Hai Fisch</span>,
    <span class="player">Slipt</span>,
    <span class="player">Letheliah</span>, and
    <span class="player">Oppressedzebra</span>
    from bringing about war.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, the Angleans and Chaladonians aren't known to get along. However, some
    goodwill might have been brought to the tropical isles by Waper, who was known to fight for
    both factions before the war began. Ultimately, the Angleans and Chaladonians formed the
    <span class="alliance">Primal Conservancy</span>, at 6000 members strong, to prevent
    fertile lands and water supplies being spoiled by the cutthroat capitalism of the
    <span class="alliance">Utilitarian Assembly</span>. Backed by the Merchants and Baronites,
    the Assembly fought for free and open trade with 5500 supporters. Despite looking down on
    the Merchants' habit of trading labor so freely, the Baronites could not strike the market
    pacts they required to feed their growing migrant population.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two alliances fought tooth and nail over resources and territories with
    <span class="player">RearAdmiralZill</span>,
    <span class="player">Shinkurex</span>,
    <span class="player">Lysanya</span>, and
    <span class="player">gloowa</span> bringing in many territory victories for the Assembly
    while <span class="player">Dementio</span>,
    <span class="player">EXPEREMENTATOR</span>,
    <span class="player">Diehard.zero</span>, and
    <span class="player">Gevurah</span> secured resource domination for the Conservancy by completing
    key Missions. In the end, The Mercantile efforts waned dramatically as the world transitioned
    into war while the Baronites struggled to shoulder the weight. Clearly, the Fjord Baronies stood
    to lose the most if they suffered a defeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, the <u>Primal Conservancy was successful</u> in protecting the bulk of the resources
    that they needed to ensure the future of their factions, and perhaps the futures of any faction
    willing to share. The Utilitarian Assembly failed to acquire enough new resources to incentivize
    the formation of new commerce agreements. The forces of the world have shifted and it will take
    some time for the dust to settle and for balance to be found. Perhaps, then, new alliances will
    be forged to fight for a different interpretation of the world.

<h2 id="midland-expansion">Midland Expansion</h2>
<article>
  <p>
    Careful and conservative skirmishes dotted the land for weeks on end. Each one seemed
    random and independent from every faction. The chaos of war covered the movements and
    alliances shifting right below the surface. However, in a sudden strike, the <span
      class="alliance">Northern Guard</span
    > revealed themselves! The powerful group of Anglean and the Baronite ships descended quickly
    on the weakened midlands. The many weeks of subtle feints and raids left the central territories
    vulnerable to this tactical thrust.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <span class="alliance">Immortal Insurrection</span>, a defensive force of Chaladonians
    and Merchants quickly withdrew their forces, conceding great swaths of the map in an
    attempt to maintain Virna, a vital straight to the north giving access to the Burren.
  </p>
  <p>
    At over 24,000 strong the Guard outnumbered the Insurrection almost two to one. To make
    matters worse KeijoPertti stood at the Guard's head directing ships and taking to the front
    lines like a sledgehammer. To his sides stood the tacticians of Anglea, <span
      class="player anglean">Aayra</span
    >,
    <span class="player anglean">Zero Zero Zero Zero</span>, and
    <span class="player anglean">Jonlrenicus</span>, and the heroes of the Baronies,
    <span class="player baron">Frostbound</span>,
    <span class="player baron">Neddie</span>, and
    <span class="player baron">Skrimskraw</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the war reached its crescendo the Merchants <span class="player merchant"
      >Desdemona Dreadless</span
    >
    and <span class="player merchant">Lord Rho of Sealand</span> spent over 200,000 of their coin
    to secure Virna. Their newly purchased mercenaries blunting the Northern Guard's advance and
    even holding their target if only for a few hours.
  </p>
  <p>
    The champions of Chaladon <span class="player chaladon">Malcolm Claridge</span>,
    <span class="player chaladon">PhaethonH</span>, and
    <span class="player chaladon">River Turtle</span>
    continued the fight, but the combined forces of Anglea and the Baronies proved too much.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <u>Northern Guard claimed victory</u>, holding the pass to the north and their
    expansion into the Midlands was complete. With funds and men low, the Insurrection
    capitulated and all that was left was to talk of how to split the conquered territory.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the governments talk peace, the world roils in chaos. In the wake of destruction and
    with so many armed men seeking profit, piracy is on the rise...
  </p>
</article>

<h2 id="the-dawns-attrition">The Dawn's Attrition</h2>
<article>
  <p>
    A hostile and brittle peace had settled in the lands of the Baronites, Angleans,
    Chaladonians, and Merchants. War had exhausted the resources and people. Thousands of
    airship shells littered the soil, bereft of their lofting balloons and stripped of
    valuables and parts. Dust slowly began to cover them, erasing previous sites of battles. It
    was if the world itself had tired of war, and wished to hide all traces from prying eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though direct fighting fell silent, there were rumors of privateers being paid under the
    table to test the skies in other foreign territories. The rumors were true, which again
    sparked hostilities between the four powers. However, the battles were not contained to old
    grounds. Two factions had recused themselves from previous great wars, caught up in their
    own conflicts. Something changed and the Yesha Empire asserted its might and began a push
    into the Burren, through Anglean territories, taking advantage of the new chaos. In a
    surprise move, the historically reclusive Arashi League also mounted a major offensive from
    its desert fortresses, deeming it time to test themselves against the might of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hate long existed between Anglea and Yesha, preventing any measure of diplomacy. Likewise,
    small but costly raids on Mercantile holdings by the Arashi removed any possible deal from
    the table. After many devastating skirmishes against each other-despite any alliances made,
    kept, or destroyed in cold blooded betrayals-previous allies reunited, eager to settle old
    scores.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anglean and Chaladon forces once again found themselves unlikely allies as <span
      class="player anglean">Hogg</span
    >, <span class="player anglean">Alette Pegasus</span>, and
    <span class="player anglean">Redzback</span>
    merged their mighty forces with the advanced fleets of
    <span class="player chaladon">Openart</span>,
    <span class="player chaladon">PhaethonH</span>, and
    <span class="player chaladon">Laggy Lagomorph</span>. Seeing a worthy challenge, leaders of
    Arashi tribes,
    <span class="player arashi">Devil's Cry</span>,
    <span class="player arashi">KingEric</span>, and
    <span class="player arashi">Sir Hob</span>
    offered their might to the newly formed
    <span class="alliance">Technocratic Union</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other side, <span class="player merchant">Astriven</span>,
    <span class="player merchant">Superior-leader</span>, and
    <span class="player merchant">Warhunterpro</span>
    of the Mercantile Guild and <span class="player baron">Valsharen</span>,
    <span class="player baron">Baron Von Teezzsh</span>, and
    <span class="player baron">Lady Elektra</span>
    of the Fjord Baronies brokered an uneasy alliance. For unknown reasons, the Yesha Empire sent
    envoys also offering to unite in battle. When asked why, their leader simply stated "<span
      class="player yesha">Ijustwanttoplay</span
    >."
    <span class="player yesha">Jaylin</span>
    and <span class="player yesha">Zennoch</span> followed suit, cementing the
    <span class="alliance">Magisterial Consortium</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With new alliances formed, and battle lines strewn across the continent, war became
    inevitable. Brutal attacks were met with stolic defences as both sides vied for control of
    key holdings. Wave upon wave of ships clashed in the sky, casting a rain of lead, steel,
    and blood upon the battered soil. Lines held, fell, and pushed as the alliances began to
    waver. The deciding hammer blow to the enemy was always just beyond reach, just one more
    battle further. A stalemate became evident as the alliances finally crumbled, each faction
    blaming the others for the failed campaign. The factions, knowing they could not hold
    territories gained in the war alone, pulled back to consolidate their own defenses. They
    all knew war would come to them again, sooner than they all wished.

<h2 id="liquid-acquisition">Liquid Acquisition</h2>
<article>
  <p>
    In a land where water is the thin line between life and death, possession of this resource
    is a very dangerous business. It is also very profitable. Who so controls the water,
    controls the profits. Dissatisfied with endeavors in previous conflicts, the Mercantile
    Guild set its eyes on this new goal. Using their vast network of trading posts, they fed
    secrets and spread rumors of each faction plotting against the other. Conflict once again
    rose amongst the war weary people. Many battles were fought, stretching each of the other
    factions' forces thin across their territories. With this, the Guild saw its opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="player merchant">Deadfairness</span>, along with
    <span class="player merchant">Rumbrum</span>
    and <span class="player merchant">Ask</span>, funnelled vast fortunes into recruiting
    troops and forging alliances in preparation for the coming invasion, hoping for key
    positions in the water monopoly. Weakened by previous wars, Chaladon chose to put aside
    their long animosity and use the efforts of the Guild to further their own agenda. If all
    fresh water was controlled by one entity, it could be much more easily managed and kept
    pure. Chaladon saw this opportunity and sent
    <span class="player chaladon">openart</span>,
    <span class="player chaladon">Malcolm Claridge</span>, and
    <span class="player chaladon">KeijoPertti</span>
    to aid in the invasion. Former Mercantile hero,
    <span class="player baron">Astriven</span>, joined the Fjord Baronies in an attempt to
    convince them to strike back at the Angleans to the north, in hopes of regaining access to
    key ancient technology sites. Agreeing, the Baronies devoted the forces they could, once
    again under the leadership of
    <span class="player baron">Lady Elektra</span> and
    <span class="player baron">Baron Von Teezzsh</span>. With the deal made, the
    <span class="alliance">Gilt-Authority</span> formed and began its attack.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ruthless invasion struck against the forces of the other three factions, shattering the
    front lines almost instantly in the grasp for ever more water. Anglean, Arashi, and Yeshan
    forces realised they faced a unified alliance, and formed an emergency coalition, the <span
      class="alliance">Vanguard Liberators</span
    >.
    <span class="player anglean">NitroPunk</span>,
    <span class="player anglean">Gbohnen</span>, and
    <span class="player anglean">Scorban</span>
    were commissioned to attack from the Anglean territory in the north, while
    <span class="player arashi">Sterbehilfe e.V.</span>,
    <span class="player arashi">The Morbose</span>, and
    <span class="player arashi">Faelihne</span> pushed from the Arashi strongholds in the
    southwest. Once again, the Yeshans send
    <span class="player yesha">Jaylin</span>,
    <span class="player yesha">Zennoch</span>, and their oddly spoken leader, "<span
      class="player yesha">Ijustwanttoplay</span
    >" to hold the central region.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite any effort, the Vanguard Liberators fell back on all fronts due to the
    <u>overwhelming attacks of the Gilt-Authority</u>, spearheaded by the Mercantile Guild. The
    Guild had adopted a strategy of quickly assaulting any capital ships present on the
    battlefield, securing the source of water, then advancing before reinforcements could
    arrive. This proved exceedingly successful in breaking and scattering the enemy forces.
    Soon, the Vanguard Liberators fell in disarray, allowing the Gilt-Authority to advance
    unimpeded. As quickly as it started, the war ended. With its mission complete, the
    Gilt-Authority dissolved its alliance. Holding the water would prove much more costly than
    simply selling to back to its previous owners. The Mercantile Guild relished in its
    newfound liquid profits as it pulled its forces back to safer territories.
  </p>
</article>

<h2 id="the-great-reach">The Great Reach</h2>
<article>
  <p>
    While Chaladon prides itself on its clemency, or so they say, some things can never be
    forgiven. When the Mercantile Guild withdrew its forces and dissolved the previous
    agreement, Chaladon found itself holding the greased end of the stick. Instead of being the
    new custodians of the known water supplies, they were forced to fall back to their own
    territories with nothing. They decided it was time to once again be 'generous', but on
    their own terms. If the savage mainlanders could not take care of their own lands, Chaladon
    would do it for them. With that, they began spilling on to the mainland with renewed
    fervor. In short order, they had claimed most of the lands the Mercantile Guild had
    promised them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having had very few conflicts with each other, the Baronites and Yeshans had been dealing
    in secret, wishing to establish trade bypassing the Mercantile Guild's vast reach and to
    start rebuilding the ancient train route between the Ash Mountains and Ridge Forest. Yesha
    formed a treaty with the Arashi, who agreed to stop raiding them on the condition that they
    may face the Anglean forces. "A worthy test." With plans set and allies gathered, the push
    began. Only the Chaladon lands stood in their way, and the newly formed <span
      class="alliance">Khanate Imperium</span
    >
    swore to take them. Chaladon was caught completely off guard by the sudden alliance and assault
    on their holdings on the mainland. Trading posts began going dark within the Guild network of
    spies. Chaladon and the Mercantile Guild found themselves in losing conflicts. With few options,
    they were forced into an Alliance with their sworn enemies, each other. The Anglean Republic
    could not abide by the thought of their two worst enemies, Yeshans and Baronites, being allied
    against them. Word of this spread to Chaladon, which offered a treaty. Having had many treaties
    with Chaladon in the past, the Angleans accepted. The
    <span class="alliance">Emerald Horizon</span> alliance formed, and war was met in full.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Baronites were surrounded, fighting battles on two fronts while they held out for
    Yeshan and Arashi forces to reach them. After many battles, they finally joined forces and
    bridged the mainland. With the Great Reach formed, they needed to expand their gains north
    and south to ensure the construction project would proceed uninterrupted. The Arashi
    insisted on forcing their way north, finally driving Anglea off the mainland at Hanat. This
    was the <u> final blow against the Emerald Horizon</u>, or should have been. Arashi
    raiders, satisfied at their victory against Anglean forces in Hanat, and rumored fearful of
    flying their ships across so much water, began to travel back to their desert homes. There,
    they immediately resumed attacking Yeshan territories. This destabilized the alliance
    between Yesha and the Baronites. While still friendly to one another, the alliance was
    suspended while each dealt with incursions in their own lands.

<h2 id="allies-and-enemies">Allies and Enemies</h2>
<article>
  <p>
    As the wheel of war slowed, old grudges simmered. Enemies glared at one another over the
    fleeting borders laid down by the fracturing of previous alliances. Sated by an abundance
    of resources won in the conflict, the Anglean Republic decided to attempt establishing
    treaties with other factions to procure a more reliable supply chain. Chaladon, however,
    had no interest in such relations. Betrayed by the Mercantile Guild on more than one
    occasion in previous conflicts, they had little trust for any alliance. Unwavered, Anglea
    formed a temporary armistice with Yesha, which was mistakenly ended due to some new, overly
    ambitious Yeshan privateers. Despite these setbacks, The Anglean Republic was able to take
    control of large swaths of the central badlands after a brief accord with the Baronites
    reduced pressure on their eastern front. This was abandoned after the Arashi presented an
    offer of supplies raided from Mercantile holdings and shipped through the desolate Red
    Range in exchange for Anglean technical expertise in maintaining their stockpiles of
    weapons raided from ancient military bases exhumed from the Arashi Desert sands.
  </p>

    The Yeshan government discovered the error of their underlings, and sent envoys to both the
    Anglean Republic and Arashi League after demoting and punishing the military upstarts.
    Yesha had already mobilized their massive war machine into the contested lands, as well as
    north and south. The Angleans quickly accepted the offer, given the choice of forming an
    alliance or letting Yesha take control of all supply routes. The Arashi also accepted the
    alliance, finding it intriguing, as well as helpful in ousting Mercantile forays into their
    lands. Together, the <span class="alliance">Sanguine March</span> alliance began their move
    east.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the eastern fronts, Chaladon had been weakened by previous failed wars. Despite this,
    they began making a strong push into the central plains. With or without the help of the
    other factions, they were determined to hold true to their vision of a unified, green haven
    on the mainland. Others did not hold that vision, as they were eventually cut off by a
    coordinated thrust onto their home island by the Mercantile Guild, valuing profit in the
    pocket over green in the eye. The Guild stood poised to take control of the entire south
    and east territories. At this point, Baronite envoys reached the Mercantile forces with
    news of the western alliance. Understanding this threat, the Mercantile Guild made two
    offers. One was to the Baronites for joining forces, which was accepted. The other was to
    Chaladon, offering to sell them back their land, at a reasonable price of course, if they
    agreed to put their forces under Mercantile control while marching against the war machine
    in the west. The Chaladonian people were outraged at such an offer, and even more outraged
    as their government accepted. Some vowed revenge on all that had opposed their vision as
    unrest grumbled in the streets and coin secretly slipped into the pockets of privateers.
    Thus, The <span class="alliance">Halcyon Cartel</span>
    began its wavering alliance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two alliances soon clashed, once again vying for control of the once independent
    central territories.

<h2 id="blood-in-the-water">Blood in the Water</h2>
<article>
  <p>
    The sun rises red on the eastern seas, painting crimson the waters, the seas, the skies...
    the people. It covers all as if in a wash of pale life-blood. Is it just the light, or does
    the still water of the morning light hold the spilled blood of heroes, villains, and
    innocents? What tales of woe do the gentle, wind teased ripples whisper? Perhaps I get
    ahead of myself, since I know the answers to these questions. It is best to start at the
    beginning, or at least a beginning.
  </p>
  <p>
    This beginning shall start in the eighth great conflict between the factions, a vicious,
    unrelenting war set between the <span class="alliance">Sanguine March</span>
    and
    <span class="alliance">Halcyon Cartel</span>. Or, perhaps I should say within those
    alliances? As with all wars, the lines between ally and enemies becomes thin. In this
    instance, that line vanished.
  </p>
  <p>
    The might of the Yeshan Empire had gathered the unwilling allies of the Anglean Republic
    and Arashi League under one banner, while the tenacity of the Mercantile Guild subdued the
    Order of Chaladon and Fjord Baronies under another. From the start, these two alliances
    festered like a corpse in a warm, damp cellar. It was only a matter of time before
    something burst, leaving an awful stench across the lands. In the case of the Halcyon
    Cartel, this was not long, since hate had festered for much greater time. Whispers of
    rebellion soon became an open revolt as Chaladonian privateers found their pockets being
    lined to turn their backs on the people they were contracted to protect. One pilot more
    than any other caused mayhem in the Chaladon ranks, diverting supplies where there was no
    need, and shifting forces to strategically insignificant territories. <span
      class="player chaladon">Sterbehilfe e.V.</span
    >, driven by mad hate of the Mercantile Guild, declared war on his own allies. In the
    confusion, it is uncertain if fellow privateer
    <span class="player chaladon">Sungsoo Jung</span>
    also turned away as Chaladon cities were raided one after the other by the Sanguine March, though
    <span class="player chaladon">Arramus</span> rejected the rebellion. Alliance loyalists comprised
    of Chaladonian, Mercantile, and Baronite privateers also formed a secret group to combat the
    actions of the rebels, though with little success.
  </p>
  <p>
    Betrayed by Chaladon, the forces of the Halcyon Cartel fell back on nearly all fronts. The
    exception was in the north, pushing dangerously far into Anglean territory. An Anglean
    regiment of privateer ships, lead by <span class="player anglean">Redbrd</span>, pulled
    away from the main front to push Baronite forces off the Sea of Graves coastline. This
    angered Yesha, with many assuming it was a betrayal to the alliance. Negotiations with
    <span class="player anglean">Hardstrike</span>
    and <span class="player anglean">JarlBeimar</span> settled this worry, attributing the
    rumors of rebellion to the hot-blooded talk of young soldiers. Yesha decided to divert some
    of its own forces north, supposedly to help with the front, though Angleans are more
    inclined to believe it was to keep a closer eye on them. Forces combined, the territories
    fell quickly.
    <span class="player baron">Triggerslipped</span>,
    <span class="player baron">Lucian Thyatira</span>, and
    <span class="player baron">King_Morpheus4</span> of the Barronese fought valiantly, but fell
    back without the full support of Chaladon. The mission accomplished, Yesha and Anglea joined
    with Arashi forces in renewed effort to cut off supply routes at Ravenrock and Vama Rea.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secretly, Chaladon rebels had been making deals with Yesha. <span class="player yesha"
      >-Bob</span
    >, allied to Yesha and credited with forming many alliances with other factions, cautioned
    the Arashi raiders
    <span class="player arashi">Non-existant</span>,
    <span class="player arashi">Bemapo</span>, and
    <span class="player arashi">Mister BOOM</span>
    to tread lightly in Chaladon lands, which was promptly ignored by the main Arashi armada as
    a sign of weakness. Instead, they took control of one of the oldest libraries in Itonia, threatening
    to burn it if a worthy foe did not come to stand against them. With all Chaladonian forces diverted
    elsewhere, the deed was done.
    <span class="player yesha">Vgmddg</span>
    and
    <span class="player yesha">Katsu Kaishu</span>, of Yesha, reported complete destruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The final holdout proved difficult to assault. Heavy coastal defenses and a steady stream
    of supplies from Vyshtorg prevented attack on Vama Rea. Mercantile privateers <span
      class="player merchant">Tinker Belle</span
    >,
    <span class="player merchant">Lopt</span>, and the
    <span class="player merchant">Duke of Bradford</span> patrolled tirelessly. Alas, for
    naught, as an Arashi night raid broke the blockade. Sanguine March forces poured into Vama
    Rea, taking the territory in a day. With key holdings cut off,
    <u>the Halcyon Cartel had lost any chance of victory</u>.
  </p>
  <p>
    By all sense of reason, the war should have ended that day, but hate is often greater than
    reason. Rather than a surrender, the new day dawned with chaos. During the night, messages
    had been sent out. Word spread like wildfire.
  </p>
  <p>"Burn Lascus, and the Mercantile Guild's coffers will be open to you."</p>
  <p>
    With the glint of gold filling eyes, many loyalties were cast to the wind. Yesha saw its
    opportunity slipping away, and made a similar offer to those that defended Lascus. Anglea
    and Arashi saw this as a final betrayal, and devoted all forces to razing every city and
    town in the territory while Yesha stood helpless.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Lascus in ruin, the alliances shattered. The Yeshan Empire had shown its strength in
    spanning the land, but made the mistake of choosing an enemy over wary allies. With the
    dream of unifying the land from the Rusted Range to the Black Channel delayed once again,
    Yesha began withdrawing its forces. As a last sign of good will, they returned Chaladon's
    territories, but with a price. All returned cities would be required to have a Yeshan
    adviser permanently stationed in local governing complexes. The Anglean Republic and Arashi
    League both stood poised to launch major attacks against Yesha. Clever Arashi pilots
    discovered a passage along the fortified zone bordering Jackson Hole, opening a path
    between Albys and Sunder in preparation of moving further inland to block Yeshan
    advancements. In the east, the Order of Chaladon also faced both of its former allies as
    the Fjord Baronies refused Chaladonian entry into any of their territories, and the
    Mercantile Guild began preparing for a massive invasion from the south. The new day is
    here. Is it the glint of the red sun, or is there blood in the water?
  </p>
</article>

<h2 id="the-northwind-charge">The Northwind Charge</h2>
<article>
  <p>
    The Yeshan armada had no more than finished the statue of their mighty warrior in Vama Rea
    when their former alliance fell into chaos. The Arashi tribes abandoned all lands
    previously taken in the war to focus efforts on what they saw as an honorless deal between
    Yesha and Chaladon. They felt robbed of a glorious fight against worthy foes. Instead, they
    faced the confused and pitiful armies betrayed by the mightiest of the supposed Chaladonian
    privateers. The glory of the fight stolen, they set their eyes on the source of these
    insults. If these slights were to be absolved, Yesha must pay.
  </p>
  <p>
    If Yesha were to pay, then there would be gold to be had. Seeing a prime opportunity to
    recoup losses incurred by the Chaladonian betrayal, The Mercantile Guild formed a pact with
    the Arashi League. Weapons for coin, and land trades for minimal aggression on their
    borders. The Arashi agreed. Gleefully, with its western border secure, the Guild began
    moving its entire armada east. The 'Chads' would also be paying as a full assault started
    against the isles of Chaladon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bruised in the war, leadership in tatters, and suffering many lossed in the fleet, the
    Fjord Baronese lords consolidated what arms and supplies they had left, and focused on
    defending key territories in their own fiefdoms. Chaladonian envoys were sent to broker a
    treaty, but were met with distrust and turned away.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dealing with the Mercantile Guild was out of the question as the guild attacked
    relentlessly from the south, the Baronites would not even talk to them, and Anglea had gone
    oddly quiet. With Yeshan advisors in all their cities, and no ally on any side, Chaladon
    had little choice but to continue working with Yesha. Hope was held that perhaps a deal
    could yet be made with the frozen north. That hope was dashed as the Anglean Republic began
    to move.
  </p>
  <p>
    There were rumors and excitement coming from the northern snows. There were no details, but
    the Angleans were on the move like never before. Rumors began to spread that they found
    something buried in the ice. Seeming to confirm this, the Angleans put out calls for
    supplies in unprecedented numbers. They promised privateers new technology in exchange for
    service in a great push south. This caused privateers and pirates to flock to the Anglean
    cause. If the rumors were true, it was uncertain if they were actually after more supplies
    for excavation, or simply wanted to be sure that no prying eyes were anywhere near their
    territory. Anglean forces, girdered by privateers, flooded in from the north. Any
    resistance was almost casually swept aside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Always looking for the next opportunity, the Guild offered a deal to Anglea to raid Yesha
    and procure the famed 'black iron' for shipment back to Mercantile holdings. They had been
    profiting immensely off from the northern push, so were content to let the Angleans take is
    much land as they wanted. Why make a war, when you can profit off from someone else's?
  </p>
  <p>
    In secret, Chaladon tried, and almost succeeded in making a treaty with the Arashi to
    attack the Mercantile Guild, since they were a 'strong enemy'. Anglean spies discovered the
    plot, however. This would have interfered with the trade deal between Mercantile and
    Anglea, so Anglea devised a strategy to make sure Arashi eyes stayed to the north. They
    challenged the Arashi to an honor duel, claiming to take up the gauntlet the Arashi left on
    the shores of Hanat.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em
      >Many battles ago, you showed your strength in pushing us to our own borders. You also
      showed your honor by ceasing this assault and leaving us a challenge. We have decided to
      accept this challenge of facing your warriors on your own lands. There is but one issue.
      The pitiful Yeshen Armada stands between us, blocking our honorable duel with their
      treacherous, backstabbing ways. Let us be the Hammer and Anvil that crushes this unworthy
      foe, so that we may join in battle at an agreed upon place and time. Let us discuss the
      terms of this honor duel and reap the spoils of War!</em
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Unable and unwilling to refuse, the Arashi completely ignored any allegiance attempts made
    by Chaladon and devoted all forces to preparing for the duel with Anglea. Even though the
    Mercantile were Arashi allies, the Guild was able to continue being partners with Anglea as
    well due to the conditions of the honor duel. This allowed the Mercantile Guild to profit
    from both sides with impunity while Yesha was crushed in the middle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anglea and the Baronites briefly negotiated to make a land exchange deal, providing the
    Baronese with much needed supplies and Anglea with key territory, but talks fail as
    individual fiefdoms break apart and tried to fight the Angleans. Unable to muster the
    forces and short on coin to pay privateers, the Baronite territories were cut in half in
    the Anglean mysterious quest for oil and ore. Unable to sustain more losses, Baronites
    surrendered fully to Anglea.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Anglean push went as far as Itonia on the Chaladonian island. Once they seemed to have
    what they wanted, the Anglean forces stopped abruptly and shifted their focus back to the
    west. Chaladon perceived that Anglea was no longer interested in taking more of their land,
    but also knew they did not have the power to take any back. Though they didn't surrender,
    they accepted a treaty to become a subordinate of Anglea to peacefully get their lands
    back, "When time comes." This also gave them a very powerful ally against the Mercantile
    Guild, which was still trying to completely overrun their land and destroy their faction
    itself. This solidified the <span class="alliance">Northwind Alliance</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the west, the Arashi still had but one goal. Everything was ignored in the face of their
    honor duel with the Anglean Republic. It is the core of their Society to find the strongest
    challenges and face them head-on. Win or lose, live or die, the fight is all.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Mercantile Guild saw the subjugation of the Fjord Baronese and Chaladon, and knew their
    trade with Anglea was at an end. Knowing they could not trust the treacherous Chaladonians,
    they saw only one way to profit from this conflict. If you can't win a war, at least you
    can still make a few coin from it. In that, you make a deal with the two factions likely to
    purchase the most weapons. To them, this seemed to be the Arashi and Yesha. Yesha has had
    the longest history with the Arashi ways, and understood that the duel with Anglea would
    not end until their honor is satisfied. This gave them the choice of standing in their way,
    or stepping aside and letting them through. They decided to wisely avoid a war on two sides
    and allow the Arashi to pass through. This formed a loose alliance between the three
    factions. One of following in the wake of a charging bull, instead of standing its path. A
    Mercantile privateer looking to turn a profit on 'genuine war merchandise' coined (and
    copyrighted) the name '<span class="alliance">Loess Collaboration</span>' for the newfound
    alliance.
  </p>
  <p>Thus, war was met.</p>

<article>
  <p>
    <em>An investigative Report on the War</em>
  </p>
  <p><em>-Anvala Press</em></p>
  <p>
    A cold wind rushed westward from the from the distant Ridge Forest Mountains, rustling the
    flags of the Arashi Ravager I found myself a passenger of. Though I normally would have
    avoided such transport, it appeared to be the only way to interview the Arashi as they
    began departing from the Midland Plains. The objects of my quarry stood on the opposite
    side of a table bolted to the floor with four mismatched brackets. They were tall, and
    dressed in their ornate war garb. The one closest to me held what looked like a long
    spearhead on a short haft, just slightly longer than would fit two hands comfortably.
    Perhaps it was one of their ceremonial spears often talked about in jest when referring to
    the 'spear shaking Arashi warriors'. Practical or ceremonial, I was not keen on finding out
    as the man leaned forward, placing his fists against the table.
  </p>
  <p>"Anvalan, ask your questions."</p>
  <p>
    Despite promises of safe passage to members of the Anvala Press, I leaned back in my chair
    reflexively. I quickly flipped open my notebook to disguise the flinch, but the small
    shadow of a smile the man gave and the low chuckles from behind him left no doubt I had
    failed. "Well, yes." I cleared my throat. "Yes. It appears the conflicts of this war have
    ended. Would you..." He made a slashing gesture with his spear, the humor of a moment ago
    gone.
  </p>
  <p>
    "War? Is that what the fools are calling this?" the haft tapped against the table. "This
    was no war. Our honor was robbed from us, and something was stolen from our sands. We came
    to reclaim both."
  </p>
  <p>"So, have you achieved your goals?"</p>
  <p>
    "We have proven our strength, once again. For the other, we tire of playing hide and hunt
    like children."
  </p>
  <p>"You mean hide and seek?"</p>
  <p>
    He ran his finger along the edge of his blade, holding his piercing gaze for a few long
    moments before answering. "Is that what you teach your children?"
  </p>
  <p>
    I cleared my throat again, trying to quell my imagination at those haunting words. "Well,
    let's focus on," I paused, not sure how far the promise of safety would go, "focus on your
    honor. The Angleans promised an honor duel, correct? Why are you so far to the East,
    instead of the ice of the north?"
  </p>
  <p>
    Angry murmurs came from the group behind him. He stood straight without looking back and
    raised what seemed like a calming hand. The murmurs stopped instantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    "That is not where the winds took us. Our goal was to return what was stolen. This convoy
    was seen heading north, but moved east through the pirate lands after their route was
    blocked by the Yeshan pigs." He seemed to make an unconscious stabbing gesture to punctuate
    the last words. "From there, it vanished. It again appeared heading further east. The
    landless insisted on following the ships. The landless serve their purpose, so we indulged
    this request."
  </p>
  <p>"The landless?" I inquired.</p>
  <p>"Those of the fallen nations, forced to beg at another's doorstep."</p>
  <p>"I see. Many nations fit that description after the fall of Cathedral."</p>
  <p>
    He lifted his chin, as if looking down on something distasteful. "They were weak. The weak
    should fall."
  </p>
  <p>
    "And what of the pirates now infesting the areas to the south of Cathedral? Even your ships
    fear to cross..."
  </p>
  <p>
    "We fear nothing." true anger filled his voice as he slammed his spear down on the table.
    "We do not pass those boundaries because it is not worth our honor to destroy lowly
    pirates. Would you have a warrior hunt mice instead of beasts? Should a warlord wander into
    gnat infested sands to boast proudly at how many he killed? You insult our honor. We are
    done."
  </p>
  <p>
    I was unceremoniously left at the next town, a small dive of a village on the border of
    Lookout and Boomtown. Luckily, my skiff captain had been following the fleet and picked me
    up in short order. Dismayed at what little we learned from the Arashi, who seemed to care
    little for intrigue in their pursuit of the next challenge, we turned our heading north to
    where we were told a Yeshan fleet was stationed. The skies were oddly empty as we traveled
    across Lookout, and into the hills of Aspara. One of the crew swore he saw several
    Chaladonian warships darting low along the horizon to the east. Though I do not doubt his
    eyes, it seemed very odd at the time that Northern Crusade ships would be skulking about in
    Southern Retribution territory. This oddity would be explained soon enough when I finally
    met with Yeshan ships a day later.
  </p>
  <p>
    There were seven warships on constant patrol around a much smaller envoy skiff. It was
    indeed surprising to see a Yeshan diplomatic ship this far east, especially on a
    battlefront. I was welcomed aboard with open arms, which put me on edge. As I entered a
    lavish, if orderly cabin, I was once again started. The stately Yeshan diplomat that stood
    as I entered was precisely as expected, well-dressed and dignified, full of pompous honor
    and duty in his greeting. His counterpart, who remained seated in quiet dignity, seemed to
    somehow look down on me even from her seat. She was slender, with delicate fingers daintily
    holding a porcelain tea cup. Lace covered the backs of her hands and entire neck to her
    chin. The deep purple of her dress left no doubt that she was Baronite nobility. Her eyes
    lifted to lock with mine. In that brief instant, I felt as if I had been weighed and judged
    to my core, from the thoughts in my head to whether I had changed to clean socks that
    morning. Though it made little sense, I was suddenly glad that I had. I shall be referring
    to her as 'Lady Gwen', and the Yeshan as 'Lord Yon' for the purpose of this report, as I
    was asked only to keep their names from the record.
  </p>
  <p>
    "My Lady, my Lord, I have come to inquire as to the war..." I paused, not sure how to
    continue, as the two in front of me were currently at war with each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    "The war is over, my good sir." Lady Gwen answered in a silky voice, her chin inclining
    slightly.
  </p>
  <p>"It is true," Yon confirmed. "We are withdrawing our fleets from the lawless lands."</p>
  <p>"All of them?" I wondered.</p>
  <p>
    The Yeshan glanced at the Noble before continuing. "Yes, all. Something strange is afoot in
    the Midland Plains and Burren. The Angleans are up to something, we are certain. Their
    forces have been scattered, and attacks sporadic. It is as if they are not purposefully
    attacking us at all, and after something else."
  </p>
  <p>
    "The convoy from the Arashi desert? It is said that a Yeshan assault blocked it's escape."
  </p>
  <p>
    His nostrils flared in anger, though his expression was that of perhaps shame. "We spent
    weeks chasing those shadows. Our military and hired ships have disappointed the Triumvirate
    in their performance. I half believe this convoy never existed, and the missives were some
    Mercantile ploy to rile the sand savages. I also question the motivations of those hired
    ships that have dishonored themselves by serving other masters. Perhaps they are still
    working for our enemies and leading us astray. Then again, as said, the Angleans have been
    behaving very oddly, even for being the ice-crazed madmen they are. In either case, we have
    failed in our duty."
  </p>
  <p>I turned to Lady Gwen. "Can you add anything?"</p>
  <p>
    "Not especially." her voice carried the air of someone talking about something far beneath
    their notice as she waved a hand dismissively. "We were mostly passive observers in this
    war. Such a savage affair. It is better to deal in more noble pursuits, with more noble
    company." A gracious smile crossed her lips as she nodded to the Yeshan. He nodded back.
  </p>
  <p>
    "There is an accord here?" I queried. I wondered why I was being given such sensitive
    information.
  </p>
  <p>
    "That will be for the Triumvirate to decide." Yon answered, easily reading my expression.
    "The Lady requested your presence here when we saw your ship approach."
  </p>
  <p>
    "Yes. I felt it was providence that brought your ship to us at this very moment. The
    civility and benevolence of the Fjord Baronies and Yeshan Empire must be told to all. It is
    through us that peace will flourish through the lands." her eyes became distant as she
    spoke, as if she could see it already happening. She gave a small smile and gracious nod.
    "All in time. I do believe you need to be on your way, as do we. I have had a small gift
    sent to your ship, in the name of good will."
  </p>
  <p>
    Lord Yon stopped me at the door. "I bid you to take this advice. Avoid the Angleans. They
    will not give such a warm greeting. They have been firing on any ship without warning, even
    those of their allies."
  </p>
  <p>
    We parted ways, my mind reeling with the developments. What exactly could this mean? Back
    on my own ship, I was presented with the Baronite's gift by my crew, who were eager to hear
    the news. Upon opening the box, I found several very expensive looking cheeses, a bottle of
    well-aged wine, several trinkets of high quality, and at the bottom in a fine paper box, a
    pair of purple silken socks. Thinking back to my initial thoughts on seeing the noble, that
    was perhaps the most troubling item of the day's events. It has been two weeks since then,
    and I have yet to try them on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shortly after parting with the envoy, we were met by another Anvalan skiff. After a short
    greeting, I was handed a missive from the City confirming what the Yeshan had said. The
    Angleans were extremely agitated, and we were to avoid any contact with Anglean ships for
    the foreseeable future. One of our Destroyers had been dispatched to Kinforth on a
    diplomatic mission. Partially glad to avoid the cold, we turned back south.
  </p>
  <p>
    The withdrawal was further confirmed at the sight of Chaladonian ships filling the skies as
    we arrived back in Aspara. We tried contacting several, but were ignored or avoided.
    Finally, we were able to spot a ship moored to the ground as it made repairs. I disembarked
    from my ship in hopes of an interview. The only person I could see was a short woman
    vigorously hammering a twisted sheet of shrouding back in place around an engine. She
    didn't look up as I approached. I opened my mouth to introduce myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    "We don't have it." she snapped angrily, cutting of anything I would have said, still not
    looking up from her labor.
  </p>
  <p>"I didn't..."</p>
  <p>
    "I said we don't have it. You think I don't know what you came here to ask about? Whatever
    cursed thing they dug up, it is not here." she made a sharp gesture pointing out smoke
    rising from various spots on the horizon. "This is not about some convy. You have all been
    lied to. When you write this story, you make sure your readers know where to lay the
    blame." her hand cut to the southwest. "Those mange infested foxes have manipulated the
    desert fools and imperial children into these actions."
  </p>
  <p>"I would like..."</p>
  <p>
    "You would like?" She slammed her hammer down loudly, finally turning to address me
    directly, "Do you think I care what an Anvalan gossip hound would like? You sit behind your
    high walls with your miracle machines while we are out here fighting for our lives. Look at
    this heap of junk!" she kicked the metal for effect. "We have to fly these deathtraps with
    skeleton crews because some fools thought it was the best idea in the world to toss our lot
    in a fight we don't have the manpower to win. So what do they do? They hire bloody pirates!
    Pirates! Pirates with no sense of loyalty or cause. We give them our best ships and
    weapons, only to have them turn around and use them against us the next day."
  </p>
  <p>"That is .. " I tried to interject.</p>
  <p>
    "That is exactly the way it is. We grabbed the beast by the tail, and can't let go or it
    will eat us whole. We can't stop this, and we can't win it." Her voice and shoulders
    dropped. "We can't stop it, but you could. I have seen your ships often enough around
    Blackcliff. I have heard what your weapons can do. Even the scavenging Angleans are afraid
    to attack you directly. Where is Anvala?"
  </p>
  <p>
    After a long pause, I finally realized that she actually wanted an answer. I thought it
    best not to mention that the Angleans had apparently been doing exactly that. Instead, I
    spoke what I had been told many times by my own leaders.
  </p>
  <p>
    "How many of our ships would it take to end this incessant conflict? One thousand? Ten
    thousand? How many infantry? Countless numbers? I am sorry, but you would have us grab the
    same beast by the tail, also without the resources to truly best it. We are one city in an
    ocean of chaos. All we can do is make sure we keep the waters out. Yes, we could easily
    defeat one, perhaps more of the fighting nations. Defeat is only half the fight. After
    which, you have to rule."
  </p>
  <p>
    She growled and turned back to her hammering. "Do... something." She punctuated each word
    with a hammer blow before paused again. "Swessland," she said quietly.
  </p>
  <p>"What?" I inquired, confused by the random word. "I don't understand."</p>
  <p>
    "It is a story that my grandmother used to tell to help us sleep. The young boy prince of
    Swessland wanted so badly to avoid the war of olden times that he built a ship to take his
    entire city to the Moon."
  </p>
  <p>I have never heard this particular tale. "What happened?"</p>
  <p>
    "He made it. He took all of his people to safety. He is up there now, in a city made of
    pearl, watching over the children of this world, promising to protect..." she trailed off,
    and it took a few moments for me to release that she was crying. Suddenly, the grand
    intrigue of the war seemed much smaller and less important than a little boy on the moon.
  </p>
  <p>
    "I am sorry," I said, and made my way back to my ship. Eventually, the hammering returned,
    each blow weighing heavily on my shoulders. I was relieved that I only have one more
    interview before my journey finished.
  </p>
  <p>
    I found my contact two days later sitting across a table from me in a small bar in a town
    on the shores of Troydon, a wide map spread between us. He was a big blustery merchant with
    long mustaches that he liked to curl as he was talking, and had a shrewd look to his eyes.
    As we studied over his trade map, I noticed a large arrow from Lutessa to Troydon with the
    trade symbol for lumber, and an X over the trade route between Serpents Point and
    Glowwater. He informed me that the latter was due to an influx of pirates in the area. We
    talked cordially for some time about other trade and pleasantries before I asked about the
    war and supposed missing convoy. As everyone knows, never let a Merchant know what you want
    the most, or you will always pay more than you are willing. He stroked his mustache and
    blew a puff of smoke from his golden crested pipe.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Talk is cheap. Information, on the other hand..." he paused. Fully expecting this, I
    pulled a purse from my pocket and tossed it to him. He caught it in one hand and hefted it,
    then ran his thumb along the side. "Eleven ferrens?" he asked. I was confused for a moment,
    sure that I had put twelve in the purse, the going rate for information. I patted my pocket
    and felt one more that must have slipped out. I flipped it to him and watched as he caught
    it between two fingers and made both the coin and purse vanish somewhere in his clothing.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Ah yes, the convoy. Of course, everything we have done is in good will to help the Arashi
    reacquire their property. A property that must be very valuable since the Angleans started
    an entire war just to hide their intentions. Not that profit ever crossed our minds, of
    course. A people should not be separated from what is traditionally thiers after all."
  </p>
  <p>
    "Of course," I agreed doubtfully. "I have been told that most of the information came
    through Mercantile means."
  </p>
  <p>
    He spread his hands, palms up with a slight shrug. "We simply followed the trail of clues
    as we could. We were informed that there were low-flying airships heading east out of
    Garrow, somehow avoiding the pirates infesting the restricted areas." he leaned forward
    through the trails of smoke to tap the tip of his pipe on the red lines laid out on the
    map. "No ships make it through there since the first conflicts a few years back. It makes
    you wonder..."
  </p>
  <p>"You think the Angleans made a deal with the pirates?"</p>
  <p>
    "Think? I think nothing. As I said, it makes you wonder." his pipe trailed further east
    through Sunder and Boomtown, then crossing into Ballast "Rumors place unknown ships hugging
    the terrain along this route. The rumors stop here." he tapped on the Black Channel with a
    sharp click. "Chaladon?" I asked, somewhat in disbelief. "Why would they take something
    from the Arashi Desert all the way to Chaladon?" He leaned back again, trails of smoke
    curling back around his face as he twisted one long moustache. "It makes you wonder," he
    said with the smile of someone about to sell you your own liver. "It made the desert dogs
    wonder for certain."
  </p>
  <p>
    I looked back down at the map, following the long line he had traced from Arashi territory
    to Chaladon. Knowing the history between the Guild and Chaladon, it seemed like a very
    convenient story. I said as much. His smile never slipped. "You, sir, wonder too much.
    Maybe it slipped past the Yeshans, and is now in Kinforth as we speak. I can't see Yesha
    having it themselves, since lies would crush their inflated sense of honor and duty. Could
    be a smoking ruin somewhere in Cathedral. Perhaps Anglea had nothing to do with this, and
    it was all the plot of the so-called alliance between the Anglean and Chaladon pirates" He
    bellowed a dismissive laugh. It was obvious that I would find little more information, so
    excused myself after a few more pleasantries.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, I found little actual information on the whereabouts, or even the existence of
    the convoy stated in the missives found a few months ago. The only source that could
    confirm its existence refused to speak to anyone. The trail started and ended in Garrow.
    From there, as the Yeshan envoy had stated, I only found shadows. I can't help but feel
    that the truth is hiding somewhere in the information I do have, but I have not been able
    to piece it together.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have gathered a list of hires from several sources that may be able to shed more light on
    the situation. These are the privateers listed as having the most influence amongst the
    forces of each faction. I shall strive to contact them in my continued investigation.

<h2 id="retribution-and-intrigue-ii">Retribution and Intrigue II</h2>
<article>
  <p><em>The Summer Palace</em></p>
  <p><em>-Anvala Press</em></p>
  <p>
    As the wars ebb and escalate, the nations work behind their curtains as they vie for the
    advantage. The military is often the only face they present. In my previous article, I was
    given a brief glimpse into the workings behind these forces. However, there is another face
    that often goes overlooked; those at the forefront of even the military. I speak of the
    privateers, mercenaries, and outright pirates that do the bidding of the nations, for their
    own reasons. As mentioned previously, I had planned on setting out on a mission to find
    these people and record their stories. Oddly, or perhaps not, very few would speak to me.
    Most would simply turn away with untrusting looks in their eyes. It stands to reason,
    though. One has to remember that these people were from strong, independent nations only a
    generation ago. Now their homelands are torn by wars and battles as the outer bordering
    nations attempt to carve up what is left.
  </p>
  <p>This is one of the stories of those few who would give me a brief interview.</p>
  <p>
    I first travelled to the northwest towards the remains of Cathedral after my interview with
    the smarmy Guild merchant. My ship was stopped just as dusk fell, as expected, at the
    border of Sunder and Cathedral. The ships were a ragtag group of random vessels of the
    older styles, as well as some of the newer ships built by the factions. None bore the
    markings of any of the factions, however. I knew this was a small part of the pirate fleet
    that prevented passage between territories surrounding the southeast of Cathedral. I also
    knew it would be the best place to start looking for answers.
  </p>
  <p>
    A long time passed before a single ship appeared and drew closer. It was a tattered Squid
    that looked as if it had seen more than its share of battles, though I could see from the
    skillful patches on the hull plating and balloons that it was well-maintained. The older
    man at the helm gave a signal with a black-gloved hand when the ship drew near enough and
    one of his crew tossed a skyline across. One of my own crew caught the line and tied it off
    in a practiced knot that would pull loose if great pressure was applied. The Squid lowered
    itself slightly, slanting the rope enough to allow someone from my crew to skyline down to
    the other ship. This, of course, would be me. Even in the best of conditions with both
    ships perfectly still, skylining between ships was extreme treacherous. I would not risk my
    crewmates for my own mission. I stepped into the harness and latched the small pulley to
    the rope. In less than a second, I was on board the other ship, facing the captain. My crew
    let the rope loose behind me, committing me to my choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that we were face to face, I could see that the captain was as war battered and
    hardened as the ship. He wore an older style tinker uniform, with grey spectacles that
    matched his grey hair. Neither hid the scars covering his face. I introduced myself and
    gave my intentions.
  </p>
  <p>
    "You my call me Bob, for now." he spoke back. He looked me over for a long time, then at my
    ship that was slowly drifting away. His features were becoming harder to make out as the
    last light of the day faded. "Very well. Your ship stays here. We will return you to it
    tomorrow."
  </p>
  <p>
    With those words, he strode back to the helm and flung the ship into a tight turn as the
    four engines roared to life. We dropped rapidly into a rising mist. The ship lurched back
    and forth through what I can only assume were bluffs and canyons, though little was to be
    seen in the dark mist. The ship traveled this way for almost an hour before coming to a
    thankful stop. I had never been on an active combat ship before, and my stomach had long
    emptied itself at the extreme motions the pilot demanded of the ship. I began to understand
    why these people were feared amongst the factions. I felt a small bump and realized were
    were docking. Judging by the intense maneuvering used to arrive at this place, I knew it
    would be pointless to ask where we were. Bob lead me off the ship by himself, leaving his
    small crew aboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a few minutes of traveling through a maze of partially ruined buildings with the
    light of dim lanterns peaking through tightly boarded windows, we arrived at our
    destination. It was a squat, sprawling building that seemed mostly intact. Its low rounded
    roof and wide stance gave it the appearance of a fat, brooding toad. As the door swung
    open, air thick with a scented smoke I am not familiar with wafted past me. Raucous shouts
    and laughter greeted us as we walked in. A few people got up to slap Bob on the back, while
    others sunk back in their seats and glared. I was lead to a table to one side, and drinks
    were brought. I noted that the bottles had Yeshan branding, while the flagons and mugs were
    a mismatched set of Baronite, Chalodonian, and Yeshan earthan and glassware. Looking around
    the room, the crockery matched the occupants. I recognized the features and garb of those
    from lands bordering the Arashi Desert, all the way to Firnfeld in the north, and
    everything in between.
  </p>
  <p>
    The table beside only had one person sitting at it. He was dressed all in an all black, but
    rather dirty curia cardinal suit with his eyes covered in flight goggles. His head wavered
    back and forth as he seemed to talk to himself. A pipe rested on the table in front of him
    trickling a tendral of the odd smelling smoke. Bob glanced over at him after seeing my
    look. "Don't mind him. Francois leCups [Trypta] is harmless... off a ship. He does not live
    in quite the same world as us." He turned back to me as he took one of the mugs in his
    battered gloves. "You wanted to talk."
  </p>
  <p>"Yes. I am hear to listen to your side of events."</p>
  <p>"Events?" he almost seemed amused, "An odd way to ask for the summary of a life."</p>
  <p>"I am only asking about the events of the wars after the Angleans..."</p>
  <p>
    Bob cut me off. "Boy, a story has no meaning if you skip to the end. You have to know where
    it started."
  </p>
  <p>"Very well," I said, pulling out my notebook. "Carry on."</p>
  <p>
    The story was a long one, taking most of the night to tell. I will summarize as best I can.
    He told of the days of his youth, a young man who lost everything when Cathedral finally
    fell due to a failed coup and brief internal war that destroyed the once mighty fleets. He
    spoke of the independent lands and Cathedral fondly, despite their hardships. Food was hard
    to come by, forcing many of the former soldiers to become pirates and mercenaries. Through
    a series of often horrendous events, he became the leader of a group of privateers and
    mercenaries, who agreed to temporary uneasy alliances with factions for their own personal
    gain. Often these alliances fell apart due to disobeying direct command from the factions
    and seeking independent action and leadership as well as having an inability to devote
    himself fully to a faction. Occasionally Francois would murmur or shout incoherently at
    something as Bob talked. This lead to more current events as he continued.
  </p>
  <p>
    "After a successful recovery from a serious injury in Chaladon and having lost my ship and
    clan, I had to start my way from the bottom again. Once I had worked off my debt to
    Chaladon and had my ship, The Summer Palace, back, I regathered some old clan members and
    we put our differences with Mercantile aside since we were in need of coin. Together with
    the clan I led attacks deep into the enemies territory. With our pockets filled from the
    war, we left Mercantile pursuing a new goal."
  </p>
  <p>
    "Interesting tale." I stated as I finished writing. "I see you didn't mention anything
    about the Anglean invasion of the Arashi Desert. What do you know about the item the
    Angleans allegedly took from the Arashi desert? Do you have any idea what it was, who has
    it, and where it is now?"
  </p>
  <p>
    Bob's eyes narrowed slightly as Francois burst out, "Lightning light gun! Arash and Angles
    have the same tech. It isn't even theirs! They stole it, just like we stole their... " he
    shook his head in confusion. "They stole our... " he slumped forward in his chair and was
    still. I half got out of my chair, worried that he might need help, but sat back down as he
    started snoring loudly.
  </p>
  <p>
    "The wars have been harder on some of us than others," Bob said as he looked at Francois
    with sad eyes. "At least we got some of us back together, even if we are not all here." He
    turned back to me. "That thing the Anglean's stole from the Arashi that vanished in Garrow,
    if your story is true? Yes, I do read. The Mercs pay well for information, don't they?" He
    leaned back in his chair, looking tired, but something else as well. Satisfied? "I don't
    have any information to give you that I didn't already sell to them. Whatever it was, those
    tech cultists wanted it really bad, so we can only assume it is some device from before the
    great war."
  </p>
  <p>
    "I see." I answered. "Then you..." my question was interpreted by loud banging on the door.
    Three rapid thumps followed by two further apart. No one entered, but the tavern went
    instantly silent.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Speaking of Anglea..." Bob spoke, looking up, eyes focusing beyond the ceiling, "Sorry
    about this. You seem a nice enough chap. You might find answers in Suna..."
  </p>
  <p>
    The last thing I saw before waking up on my ship the next morning with a pounding head was
    a fingerless-gloved fist filling my vision. My crew told me that I was 'delivered' just
    before dawn right after they had spotted Anglean warships on the distant horizon. Knowing
    we would get no more information, I told my crew to set course for Suna. Something tickled
    the back of my mind as the engines wound up. I touched my eye, which was already swollen
    from the punch. I jolted as if stuck again. Black gloves. Bob had been wearing full black
    gloves.
